## How to use the API

Currently below api supported in server. we are using port 5000:

1.  Hello OneNote
    -   http://localhost:5000/      ***Type: GET***

2.  All the API after ***/api*** require authorization code. you can set it by creating a header named ***authorization***
    -   currently three value hardcoded for the testing purpose, later this value will be generated by AWS Cognito service.
        -   amir-auth-code
        -   ramin-auth-code
        -   davod-auth-code

3.  Hello OneNote API
    -   http://localhost:5000/api      ***Type: GET***

4.  GET user values
    -   http://localhost:5000/api/user      ***Type: GET***
        -   you need two query string for calling this api
            -   id: This is user ID. we have three hardcoded value for this id:

                -   ramin
                -   davod
            -   num: represent the number of message you want to receive. It is an optional value and if user didnt specify it system assume it as 1.
